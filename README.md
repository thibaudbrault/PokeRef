<h4>Main goal</h4>  

My main goal for this site was to learn to use React JS and to use an Api. I chose to use PokéApi because there was a lot of tutorial to start from, the documentation was very clear and easy to use and there is a ton of information so I could make an bigger site.  

<h4>Contents</h4>  

- All the 898 pokémon + regional variants, mega and gmax  
- Moves : basic data, effect, pokémon that can learn it, ...  
- Abilities : effect, pokémon that have this ability (normal or hidden), ...  
- Types : effectiveness against other types, pokémon with this type, ...  
- Items : effect, flinch power, ...  
- Machines : list of tm and hm for every game  
- Locations : coming soon
